        <li class="history">The Neolithic era (8 000 years ago) saw the first traces of life. Humans arrived in the area because of the abundant natural resources. 
		Even today, the best-preserved eight-thousand-year-old Neolithic dwellings in Europe may be observed. Their aesthetics mesmerize with their various ceremonial and everyday objects. 
		The first metal mines in Europe, which date back over 7,000 years, are located adjacent to the modern city. The name of the first settlement formed in that site by the Ancient Thracians in the 4th century (Beroe), 
		according to certain interpretations, is tied to those mines.</li>
        <li class="history">During the Roman Empire's second century, Emperor Trajan established the city of Augusta Traiana. 
		The city grew to become the province's second largest commercial, administrative, and cultural center, and it thrived.</li>
        <li class="history">Throughout the Middle Ages, the city's name was changed multiple times. Stara Zagora was known as Vereia, Irinopolis, and Boruy during the 6th and 14th centuries.</li>
        <li class="history">The city was conquered by the Ottomans in 1372 and given the name Eski Zagra until the mid-nineteenth century, when it was changed by Todor Shishkov, a teacher. 
		The Bulgarian aristocracy of Stara Zagora agreed to rename the city Zheleznik. The new name referred to the region's long history of iron mining.</li>
        <li class="history">The city received its current name Stara Zagora in 1871, during the Council of Constantinople, thanks to the newly constituted diocese and the local people's perseverance.</li>
        <li class="history">In the summer of 1877, in the neighborhood of Stara Zagora, one of the most decisive engagements of the Russo-Turkish War took place. 
		This combat served as a baptism of fire for the Opalchentsi (volunteer Bulgarian army battalions) defending the Samara flag.</li>
        <li class="history">The city's resurgence began in 1879, shortly after Bulgaria's liberation, and was guided by the Austrian-Hungarian architect Lubor Bayer's urban design. 
		On October 5, 1879, Aleko Bogoridi lay the foundation stone for the new city.This date has now been designated as the city's official holiday.</li>
        <li class="history">The town of Stara Zagora has been burned to the ground and raised from ashes in a number of devastating fires. 
		It has entered the modern era as an important cultural center and as a vital thriving community with tree-lined streets, lively cafes and beautiful parks.</li>
